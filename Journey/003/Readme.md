# Docker

## Beginner Introduction - Continued

- Lack of Linux knowledge showing up. Course is interesting and the labs are fun to do. 80% completed. Got confused at Docker Compose. Happy that spent a good two hours to sit and study. Didn't intend to take a break of 3 days, but just couldn't shrug of the laziness although attempted to study during weekends.

## Cloud Research

- While doing the labs found that docker run --mount works only if the source directory already exists. If running for the first time, directory needs to be manually created. But docker run -v automatically creates the source directory.
