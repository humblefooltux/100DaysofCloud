# Kicking off!!

## Git and Github

Chose to learn Git and Github so as to start of my challenge journey.

## Use Case

This document itself is a use case :).

## Cloud Research

- I followed along the Git and Github for Begineers course by freeCodeCamp. I got stuck while doing a git clone, as I did not have ssh keys. Learnt how to create ssh keys and add them to git hub account. Learnt how to establish connection using the ssh key. Now I undestand the basics of Git like git clone, git add, git push, git pull. Hopefully, I will learn more in the coming days by doing.
